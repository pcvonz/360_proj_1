  <h1> Faxian  </h1>
  <h2> The brief </h2>
    <p> As a school project, I developed a branding system and website for a fictional company that dealt with Sustainability Consulting.</p>
  <h2> Research </h2>
  <h3> Competitors </h3>
    <img src="/images/faxian/brands.png">
    <p> 
    The landscape of design in sustainability consulting is
    very underutilized. Most companies use a leaf motif with a wordmark. 
    I wanted Faxian to stand out but still utilize what works. 
    Keep the elements that identify the company as environmentally conscious,
    but emphasize their business savvy.  
    </p>
    <h3> Brand direction </h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Bold serious font </li>
      <li> Illustrative elements </li>
    </ul>
